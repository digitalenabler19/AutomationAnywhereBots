# This is an A360 sample bot to convert a UIPath bot to A360 bot

##This bot is internally running a python script. Python script is expecting a input folder which should have 3 required files
## Required file 1 : AABotTemplate.json
## Required file 2 : UIPathBot.xaml (exported UIPath bot)
## Required file 3 : UIPathCommands.json

## This UIPath bot contains only 2 message boxes. You can add more commands to the UIPathCommands.json and add corresponding A360 templates to ABotTemplate.json to extend this solution to all the exsting commands in UIPath.
