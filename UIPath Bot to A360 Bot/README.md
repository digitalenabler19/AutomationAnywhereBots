# This is an A360 sample bot to convert a UIPath bot to A360 bot

##This bot is internally running a Python script. Python script is expecting an input folder which should have 3 required files
##Required file 1 : AABotTemplate.json
##Required file 2 : UIPathBot.xaml (exported UIPath bot)
##Required file 3 : UIPathCommands.json

##This UIPath bot contains only 2 message boxes. You can add more commands to the UIPathCommands.json and add corresponding A360 templates to ABotTemplate.json to extend this solution to all the existing commands in UIPath.

##The bot is internally using "ApiBot upload" command to upload the bot to A360 Control Room.
